        <h2 id="Case Study: FEMA Trailers Post Katrina"> Case Study: FEMA Trailers Post Katrina</h2>
        <p>     In late August of 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, displacing over a million people, causing $125 billion in damage, and killing 1,836 people. Weeks later, Hurricane Rita also hit the region, continuing the mass destruction (Plyer, 2016). With thousands of citizens displaced, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) ordered 120,000 trailer homes from 60 manufactures (Smith, 2021).</p>
        <p>These trailers were built hastily, and because of that, the engineered wood that went into these homes was not properly heat treated. The lack of proper heat treating led to levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, (image to the left is a Lewis structure of the formaldehyde molecule. File, 2022), that were dangerous to inhabitants, causing respiratory illness, headaches, nosebleeds, greater risk of cancer, and cognitive decline (Formaldehyde, 2014).</p>

        <p>FEMA knew of the dangerous levels of formaldehyde as early as 2006 but stopped testing levels in the trailers soon after. In 2007, FEMA planned to phase out the toxic trailers and move inhabitants out of them as soon as possible. By 2008, a congressional hearing found that the trailers were unfit for human habitation and forced FEMA to stop giving the trailers to the public and instead keep the toxic trailers in outdoor lots for evidence. This court order expired in 2010, making the trailers available for resale to auction houses across the country (Smith, 2021).</p>
        <p>These auction houses sold the trailers to thousands of people unaware of the toxic nature of the building materials. Those that bought the trailers were often low-income citizens who did not have many alternatives and could not afford the cost of sickness brought on by acute formaldehyde exposure. These FEMA trailers can still be purchased online and are used across the United States as housing for people that do not know the toxicity of their home.</p>

        <h2 id="What Went Wrong?"> What Went Wrong?</h2>
        <p>     As the federal agency in charge of emergency management, FEMA was not prepared to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Though it was an extremely destructive storm, FEMA should have been better prepared to shelter storm victims. By not having emergency shelters at the ready, FEMA had to hasten construction, leading to improperly heat-treated wood and toxic levels of formaldehyde.</p> 
        <p>Even after the rollout of these emergency trailers, FEMA stopped testing formaldehyde levels in an effort to ignore the problem and level of response needed. Then, the trailers were spread around the country through auctions, further exacerbating the problem of toxic exposure.</p> 
        <p>The lack of preparation before the storms, oversight during manufacturing, and response to the toxic conditions of these trailers made FEMA's actions unethical.</p>

        <h2 id="Steps to Take for the Future"> Steps to Take for the Future</h2>
        <p>     The Federal Emergency Management Agency's list of core values includes integrity: "We earn trust by being accountable, present, honest, and dependable" (FEMA, 2022). With the lack of accountability from FEMA years after the initial rollout of the toxic emergency trailers, the agency must make a strong commitment to improving the living conditions of its emergency shelters for the American people and their trust in FEMA.</p>
        <p>As the climate continues to warm, "the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur" (USGS, 2022). This means that destructive storms like Katrina will become more intense and more frequent. More and more Americans will be at risk of losing their homes due to extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires. Now it is more important than ever to ensure that the wrongs made in response to Katrina are not repeated.</p>
        <p>Therefore, FEMA needs to allocate more funding to design, build, and prepare healthy emergency shelters. The agency must work with progressive designers and citizens who have experienced climate displacement and possibly have lived in FEMA trailers. By working with the end-users of these shelters, the design of these improved shelters will be tailored to the needs of real people and their experiences. Designing with empathy means understanding the faults of the past and improving on them for the future.</p>

        <h2 id="Materials to Consider"> Materials to Consider</h2>
        <p>     Material science has made great strides in the past 16 years since Katrina. On the issue of engineered wood like plywood, an obvious solution would be properly heat-treating formaldehyde-containing woods to evaporate the glues to a safer level. Another option would be to use plywood with soy-based glues which have become a viable option. Even with formaldehyde containing plywood, which is most structural plywood, there are less toxic options like softwood plywood, which contains phenol-formaldehyde. Phenol-formaldehyde is less toxic than most other formaldehyde glues and it offgasses faster leading to an overall less toxic yet still structurally sound shelter (Segura, 2022).</p>
        <p>Insulation is another component of our buildings that often contain VOCs (volatile organic compounds). Typically, trailers and traditional homes use fiberglass insulation which can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and airways when exposed or disturbed. A more natural and safe option would be cellulose based insulation, which can be blown in or placed as batting. A healthy and environmentally safe option that is on the rise would be hemp insulation. Hemp is currently expensive due to the lack of highscale farms producing it, but the plant is extremely versatile for construction (Non-Toxic, 2022).</p>
        <p>To prevent mold contamination (which has been another issue with the FEMA trailers in humid environments), sandwich construction and single hull construction can be utilized. Sandwich construction makes the space between metal or fiberglass surfaces airtight with rigid foam insulation which can be laminated together for further moisture protection. Single hull construction uses fiberglass to limit the amount of empty space where condensation can gather to grow mold (Travel, 2022).</p>
        <p>Providing more windows can also reduce the toxins within these trailers by allowing residents to open their windows to aerate their space. Windows to the outside also improve residents mental health, which is especially important after disasters. Fresh air and views to the outside help residents both physically and mentally.</p>

        <h2 id="Ethical Architecture"> Ethical Architecture</h2>
        <p>     Ethical Architecture seeks to create the best design for the end-user(s) through the categories of health, community, and responsibility. By focusing on maximizing the positive outcomes in each category, a new architectural way of thinking rooted in positive principles will become widely adopted and developed through trial and error. This will push our ways of manufacturing to be more advanced and less invasive to our health and the health of the earth.</p>
        <p>By FEMA designing, building, and preparing healthy emergency shelters, the government is taking ethical steps to prepare our country for the effects of climate change. It is imperative that we prepare ourselves, but it is equally important that we transform our ways of manufacturing and design thinking.</p>
        <p>Attached below are two "Sketched Solutions", ideas of how the FEMA emergency trailer can be made more ethical. "Sketched Solution 1" examines how a generic model FEMA trailer can be made healthier with ventilation, light, ADA access, off-grid energy production, and interior and exterior materials. "Sketched Solution 2" examines other precedents of emergency shelters with different materials, forms, installation method, and flexibility. Different designs for installation and packing were inspired from these precedents. The ability to flat-pack the shelter, have ADA access, home amenities, and ventilation makes this a more flexible emergency shelter.</p>
